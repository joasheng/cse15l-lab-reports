1. When entering cd with no arguments provided, nothing is outputted. The working directory was /home. However, upon further testing, using cd from a working directory that wasn't the root directory changed the working directory back to the root. So, entering cd with no arguments returns the directory back to the root, which seems like a reasonable and intended purpose of the command (not an error).

2. When entering cd with a directory provided, the working directory of the user is changed to the argument. Before running the command, the working directory was /home, but it was changed to /home/lecture1 after. Here, the subdirectory is shown after the green tilde (note the root directory /home is not shown) to indicate the new working directory. Since this is exactly what cd was designed to do, the output was not an error.

3. When entering cd with a file provided, an error message saying the given file is not a directory is returned. The working directory was /home, and test.java was a file in that directory, but since you can't change directories to a file, an autogenerated error message was provided.
